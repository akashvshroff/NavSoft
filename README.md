## USAGE GUIDE

- To run the code, you must install the requirements, which can be done using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
- Moreover, ensure that you have the data file saved locally and edit the path used to call it. 
- Finally, you need API access to the OpenAI system. Using this, generate a key and add it to a file called secret.py (or set it as an environment variable and import it).
